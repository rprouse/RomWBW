                     Documentation for DA.COM v2.2 (1/87)

     DA is a super directory utility ("DA" stands for Directory-Attributes)
that will run on any Z80 CP/M system (2.2 or 3.0).  It is like XDIR and STAT
(or SET and SHOW) rolled into one, but takes just 2k of disk space.  DA can:

    *  show the files on a disk, the space they take, and free space
    *  give an alphabetized directory with file sizes
    *  select on, display, or change file attributes


                                   USING DA

SYNTAX:    A>da {du:}{filespec} {[}{op}{attributes}}     ("{}"=optional)

        where  "du:" may include a drive and/or user number, eg "B14:";
               "filespec" may include wildcards ("*", "?");
               "[" is a delimiter before any operands or attributes;
               "op" may be one or two of the operands "#?~+-";
               "attributes" are any or all of: "RSA1234".

       If you are specifying operands/attributes, they must be separated from
       the filespec by either a space or "["; if the filespec was omitted, the
       "[" is mandatory.  Generally, only one operand should be specified; the
       exception is that "~" may be used after "?" or "#".

ATTRIBUTES:   If attributes are specified, only files WITH them are shown.
       There are 7 attributes a file may have:
         R = READ/ONLY -- the file cannot be erased or modified.
         S = SYSTEM -- the file will not appear in an ordinary DIR.
         A = ARCHIVE -- the file has not been changed since last archived.
                       (Note: only CP/M 3.0 fully supports this attribute.)
         1,2,3,4 -- no established meaning, use for your own purposes.

OPERANDS:  "~"... Show only files WITHOUT following attributes.
           "#"... Show file sizes in RECORDS as well as K.
           "?"... Show file ATTRIBUTES instead of sizes.
           "+"... SET and show following attributes on specified files.
           "-"... CLEAR and show following attributes on specified files.


                                   EXAMPLES

     Suppose we have a fictitious 183k disk with five files.  First we'll try
the different DA display modes.  (Note: all the following assumes that alpha-
betization is horizontal, and "*.*" defaulting is on.)

A>da
A0:    86k in   5 files use   86k  (  95k free)
ALPHA   .FIL   6k > BETA    .FIL  51k > DA      .COM   2k > GAMMA   .FIL  18k
OMEGA   .COM   9k

A>da [#
A0:    86k in   5 files use   86k  (  95k free)
ALPHA   .FIL   47r   6k > BETA    .FIL  402r  51k > DA      .COM   14r   2k
GAMMA   .FIL  140r  18k > OMEGA   .COM   72r   9k

A>da [?
A0:ALPHA   .FIL  RS----- > BETA    .FIL  ------- > DA      .COM  -S-----
A0:GAMMA   .FIL  --A---- > OMEGA   .COM  -S-1--4

A>da a1:
A1:     0k in   0 files use    0k  (  95k free)

A>da *.xyz [?
A0:NO FILE

     Now we try getting selective lists, by specifying attributes.

A>da [s
A0:    17k in   3 files use   17k  (  95k free)
ALPHA   .FIL   6k > DA      .COM   2k > OMEGA   .COM   9k

A>da [?rs
A0:ALPHA   .FIL  RS-----

A>da *.fil[~a
A0:    57k in   2 files use   57k  (  97k free)
ALPHA   .FIL   6k > BETA    .FIL  51k

     Now we start changing some attributes.

A>da *.fil[+3
A0:ALPHA   .FIL  RS---3- > BETA    .FIL  -----3- > GAMMA   .FIL  --A--3-

A>da *.com[-1234
A0:OMEGA   .COM  -S----- > DA      .COM  -S-----



                                  ADVANTAGES

     DA gives a more convenient way to set attributes than the usual CP/M
commands.  It displays attributes in an intuitive way, instead of using video
bits or lowercase on filename characters as do other programs.  And it is the
only utility I know of that can give selective lists of files by attributes.
     DA is careful to give accurate statistics.  The disk involved will be
reset before it is accessed, so you can change disks and use DA without fear. 
The file sizes are exact, rather than rounded up to your block size: DA will
show a 1k file as 1k, even on a hard disk with 4k blocks; most other programs
would report 4k.  The disk statistics message gives the actual space taken up
on your drive (the "use" figure) as well as the total of the real file sizes,
in case these differ.
     (Note: a "record" is 128 bytes; a "K" is 8 records, 1024 bytes.  A
"block" is a unit typically from 1K to 4K, depending on your disk format.)


                                 LIMITATIONS

     When DA is used on unusual "media", such as ROM or tape "drives" on some
lap portables, the disk statistics may be inaccurate.  This is a general
problem, due to the implementation of CP/M on these machines.
     DA has a few numerical limits.  It can only cope with up to 255 files,
999k filesizes, and 8190k free space.  This should be adequate for all floppy
and some hard disks.


                            OPTIONAL: User Patches

      0108h : directory columns             010Ah : default to "*.*"?
      0109h : vertical alphabetization?     010Bh : maximum drive

     You can vary the number of columns in which DA displays the directory. 
Patch address 0108h in DA.COM (with DDT, SID etc) to the number you want. 
Each column is 18 characters wide.  The default is 4 columns for an 80-column
screen; 3 works well on a 52-column Osborne; 2 works with 40-column screens. 
(Note that in the attribute or records mode, the number of columns in the
display will be one less in each case.)
     You can choose whether you want the directory alphabetized horizontally
or vertically.  Patch address 0109h to FF for vertical (the default is 00 for
horizontal).  DA will use ">" as a file separator in horizontal mode, and "|"
in vertical mode.
     You can choose whether to default to "*.*" when you use DA without a
filename.  Ordinarily this is so; typing "DA" is the same as "DA *.*".  If you
prefer to get just the disk statistics when you type "DA" alone, patch address
010Ah to 00.  (The default is FF.)
     The maximum drive allowed is stored at 010Bh (default is 0F, for CP/M's
upper limit, drive P:).  If you want, you can decrease this to reflect the
actual number of drives on your system (01 would be B:).  Any attempt to
access a higher drive will be ignored, avoiding BDOS select errors.


                               VERSION HISTORY

  Versions 1.0-1.6: gradual improvements (still only 1K).

  Version 2.0: completely rewritten, now 2K.  New multiple display formats,
user number support, much faster.
  v2.1-2.1c: more user patches, small bug fixes.
  v2.2: "[" allows options without filename; new option "#" shows records.
