    HISTORY:
    -------
    The history of DIRR is quite clouded.  It was likely called D.COM
    originally and probably written in 'C'.  Jim King disassembled it
    and obviously spent a considerable amount of time in documenting
    and altering it for his terminal, printer and time-date board.  It
    was limited for use with Z80 processors.  He called his version
    DI214.COM.	His work was mostly done around December 1983.

    I had independently modified the original D.COM program for a dis-
    play I liked a lot more, but renamed my version DIRR.COM.  This
    was done so it would not interfere with any changes the original
    author might wish to make in future releases of D.COM, and would
    minimize any animosity to my making such extensive changes to his
    program, then using his original name.

    In early December 1985, I found Jim King had the source code for
    his Z80 version, and he graciously made that available.  I made a
    large number of changes and again thought I should call my version
    something different from either D.COM or his DI214.COM.  This ver-
    sion is again called DIRR.COM as the display is almost identical to
    the version I have been using for some time, and distributed under
    the name DIRR2.COM.

    The most important thing I did was to rewrite it in normal 8080 code
    and eliminate the macro libraries that were required.  It may now be
    used on any CP/M-80 v2.2 computer with 8080, 8085 or Z80 processor.
    It may now be assembled with any normal assembler.	Numerous other
    changes were made, which include making the reverse video optional.
    Several new options were added, and all were changed to be similar
    to those offered for the 'SD' directory program, where possible.
    This should make it easier for people to move between the two pro-
    grams - note there is no "D" option with this program, at present.
    In early January, I updated the pragram to work with CP/M 3.0, as I
    found a large number of people with CP/M 3.0 (especially Commodore
    C128 owners) were trying to use the program but getting incorrect
    "space remaining" displays.


    PURPOSE:
    -------
    DIRR makes an alphabetical list of the CP/M directory files and in-
    cludes the file length.  A number of options are available to make
    the program quite useful.  These are listed below.	Several of them
    are likely unique to this program.	Most can be set to be activated
    by default, if preferred.

    The program is for CP/M-80 v2.2 or v3.0 and can run with 8080, 8085
    or Z80 processors.


    EXAMPLES OF USE:
    ---------------
    DIRR ?	 help guide that shows all the options
    DIRR	 lists all non-"SYSTEM" files in the current user area
    DIRR *.COM	 lists all the ".COM" files in the current user area
    DIRR B:*.*"  lists all files on drive B: in the current user area
    DIRR *.* $A  lists all programs in all user areas on current disk
    DIRR *.* $E  gives an extended display of user area and attributes
    DIRR *.* $S  lists all files including .SYS system files.
    DIRR $AES"	 extended listing of all files this disk


    OPTIONS, QUICK REFERENCE:
    ------------------------
103H	A - shows files from all user area on current disk
104H	C - compressed display, 5 rows, no file size included
105H	E - extended display, shows user areas and attributes
106H	F - Makes a disk file after the CRT display is done
107H	N - Does not stop at full screen, else shows [more] when full
108H	P - Printer output, does not display on CRT
109H	S - Includes any systems files (most useful with $AES)
10AH	V - Version number and date


    OPTIONS, DETAILED:
    -----------------
    DIRR $A	 Shows all the files on the disk, alphabetized, no user
		 areas shown (use the 'E' option to include user area.)

    DIRR $C	 Compressed listing - 5 rows instead of 4, leaves off
		 the file length to get the extra row for users with
		 very large disk systems.  Overrides 'E' option request.

    DIRR $E	 Extended display, easily the most unique feature of
		 this program.	Shows one row less than normal, but
		 to the right of each row it shows the user area of
		 the file just listed and then has a separate area for
		 each of the attributes:

				archive bit
				read/only file
				system file

    DIRR $F	 After displaying the directory, will then make a disk
		 file of the same information, called ~DIR.  Using this
		 special character will insure the file is listed at the
		 very end of a normal display where it is easily found.

    DIRR $N	 When the CRT display fills, DIRR stops with a [more]
		 message on the bottom line.  Touching any character on
		 the keyboard restarts the display.  The 'N' option will
		 keep the display running until finished with no stops.

    DIRR $P	 Prints the output for a hard copy.  Option offered for
		 sending control strings to the printer for the print
		 font preferred, etc.  Another option returns it to the
		 normal print size, etc. when done printing.

    DIRR $S	 Includes any systems files that meet the original re-
		 quest - the ideal display for these files would be to
		 use options '$AES'.

    DIRR $V	 Shows the version number and date.

    DIRR $ACEFNPSV  -  causes ALL of the above options to be used.

		 NOTE:	A few options cannot work well at the same time.
			For instance, 'C' overrides the 'E' option as it
			not possible to compress to 5 rows and also
			expand to just 3 rows showing user areas and
			attributes.  Keeping this in mind, the options
			may be entered in any order.



			     SUMMARY:

    Special Note:  DIRR alphabetizes vertically, but in a quite unique
    manner that has established its popularity.  If the file names can
    all be shown at one time, then the DIRR display is similar to that
    of some other programs.  When they can't be all shown at one time,
    DIRR has two different types of displays available.

    To help simplify the explanation, assume a normal display of 24x80.
    the bottom line will display [more] after the screen fills, leaving
    23 lines of 4 rows, or 92 total files displayed.

    The normal display alphabetizes the first 92 files into four rows
    and displays those, saying [more] on the bottom line to indicate the
    user should tap any key to continue.  It then alphabetizes the next
    92 files and displays those, etc. until finished.  DIRR is perhaps
    the only directory program available that works in this manner.

    If the 'N' option (nonstop) is selected, the entire directory is
    first alphabetized and placed into four rows, the top 23 lines
    shown on the first screen, then the next 23 lines, etc.  This is
    very similar to other programs such as SD, where the same method is
    used whether you operate the 'N' option or not.

    When sending to the printer where 56 lines are typed between form
    feeds, the first 220 files are alphabetized, etc.  This makes each
    hard copy page somewhat independent of any others.

    These special features are difficult to describe.  They are quite
    quite unique in performance and unlike other programs, such as "SD"
    which originally offered only horizontal alphabetization.  This is
    pretty difficult to scan rapidly for content, and much harder to de-
    termine if a specific file exists on this system while looking at a
    general listing.  DIRR alphabetizes vertically, which is more common
    to general index listings and may be rapidly scanned for content.

    The header at the bottom has some very interesting information.
    Here is one from a system using a 1 megabyte floppy disk drive:

		B: 984k   Used: 31/412k   Free:  97/572k

    This says the disk has 984k available to the user, 31 files and ex-
    tents have been used totaling 412k leaving 572k and room for 97 more
    file names.  Few other directory programs give all this information.
    Some users frequently run out of room for new file names before they
    exhaust all the disk space, so this information is very useful.

    Try DIRR, you may like it better than what you have been using.  In
    any case, it has some quite unique features you are certain to like.
    (Suggest you rename it to D.COM on your working disk as you can then
    just type "D <ret>" to activate the program.  This is a lot easier
    than typing "DIR <ret>" for the normal display - and display lots of
    additional information as well.)

    It does have some modest drawbacks - it can only be used on one disk
    drive at a time, has no provision for use with RCPM systems using a
    wheel byte, and no means of limiting outside users to certain drives
    or maximum user areas.  It is excellent however for local use on any
    size disk system.
