This library contains a file called FORLBR.COM which is a modified version
of Irv Hoff's FOR.COM distributed with KMD23. It is used to search the
DISK.DIR listing created by SD138. Patch the drive and user that DISK.DIR
is located on at 103h and 104h. Current values are drive A and user 0.

FORLBR.COM can search for multiple files by seperating the filenames with
the | character. FORLBR can be used with the ? wildcard but not the * wildcard.
FORLBR is intended to be used to search the DISK.DIR for files contained
inside of .lbr,.arc, and .ark files. The /E option with the /L option is
used to create a disk.dir containing only only these listings.

A typical command line might be SD /ADEFNL.

A summary listing of number of files in each user area and disk along with
a grand total can be shown by using the command SD /ADEN.

A master DISK.DIR can be created for a set of floppies by running SD138 with
the /F option for each floppy. If a disk.dir is already present, each new
run is appended to the old file. In this way, a master listing can be created
containing all files with each .LBR, .ARC and .ARK file listed as well.

Note that a search for FILE.TXT would fail when searching the DISK.DIR listing
with FORLBR since the file would be listed as FILE    .TXT. For this reason,
only use the first few characters of the filename when using FORLBR.
