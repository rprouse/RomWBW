# RomWBW loader for MSX

The loader can be started from the MSX-DOS 1, MSX-DOS 2 or Nextor command prompt.

It will check the RAM mapper requirements based on the size of the rom image file.

The "MSX_std.rom" image must be copied to "MSX-STD.ROM" on the MSX disk media together with "MSX-LDR.COM".
